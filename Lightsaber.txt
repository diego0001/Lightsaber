Project Lightsaber

Project Lightsaber is the alpha name of a desire to bring the power of Common
Lisp into an integrated package for web development.

Release notes and feature ideas will go in this text file as the time allows.

The first thing to do will be to get a copy of Steel Bank Common Lisp and
follow the instructions to install it. 
SBCL is located here: http://www.sbcl.org/getting.html

Secondly, we need to install packages: Hunchentoot, CL-WHO, ParenScript, 
and Common Lisp SQL. These can be done by using SBCL's ASDF build facility. For
more information on this, go here: http://www.cliki.net/asdf
At some point, we'll want to have a script that will automatically get
Hunchentoot, CL-WHO, ParenScript, and CL SQL, but today is not that day yet.
