Project Lightsaber

Project Lightsaber is the alpha name of a desire to bring the power of Common
Lisp into an integrated package for web development.

Release notes and feature ideas will go in this text file as the time allows.

The first thing to do will be to get a copy of Steel Bank Common Lisp and
follow the instructions to install it. 
SBCL is located here: http://www.sbcl.org/getting.html

Secondly, we need to install packages: Hunchentoot, CL-WHO, ParenScript, 
and Common Lisp SQL. More information on this as I install them.
